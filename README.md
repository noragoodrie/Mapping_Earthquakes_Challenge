# Mapping_Earthquakes_Challenge

This assignment we were told to create 3 maps. Street view, satalite and a create your own which I chose to make a dark mode map! We also needed to add tectonic plate lines as well as high magnitude earthquake makes which you can see below within the photos from my github pages form!

Checkout the interactive map at https://noragoodrie.github.io/Mapping_Earthquakes_Challenge/ . You can toggle the different maps in the right hand corner of the webpage!
